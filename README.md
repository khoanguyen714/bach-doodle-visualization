# Bach Doodle Dataset
Over 8 million players have contributed around 24 millions harmonizations after playing with the Bach Google Doodle. These harmonizations are a unique data set that can show insights on how people around the world composed melodies, help developers train new Machine Learning algorithms, or artists create musical experiences. That’s why we’re open-sourcing the dataset.

This project provides several visualizations to explore the data, such as
visualizing the top overall repeated melodies, the top repeated melodies in each country, or
the regional hits  -- melodies that only appeared in one country and not in the other ones.
