      <h1>Exploring the <span class="accent yellow">Bach Doodle</span></h1>
      <p>
        Over xx players have contributed around 24 millions harmonizations after playing with the Bach Google Doodle.
        These harmonizations are a unique data set that can help developers train new neural networks, 
        help researchers see patterns in how people around the world compose melodies, and help 
        musicians create things we haven’t begun to think of. That’s why we’re open-sourcing the dataset.

      <h2>The dataset</h2>
      <p>
        Of the more than 50 million requests to the doodle itself, the user contributed dataset contains 
        over 21.6 million miniature compositions totaling 78.8 years spent composing.
        The compositions are split across 8.5 million sessions -- each session represents 
        an anonymous user's interaction with the web app and may contain multiple data points.

      <h2>Repeated compositions</h2>
      <p>
        Not every melody entered was unique! A lot of you entered your favourite pop songs,
        or other Bach pieces you wanted to see how the model would harmonize with. These
        repeated sequences surfaced through the top, and you can visualize the top 2000 below. 
        We've also split them across country, to see what people composed across the world!
